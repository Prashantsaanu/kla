# ✅ QWLA Tattoo App - Development Checklist

## 1. Authentication & Authorization
- [✅] Implement `/login` with JWT
- [ ] Password verification with Passlib
- [ ] Protect routes with JWT dependency
- [ ] Role-based access (`admin`, `client`, `artist`)

## 2. Database & Models Expansion
- [ ] `Tattoo` model (title, description, image_url, artist_id, created_at)
- [ ] `Booking` model (client_id, tattoo_id, date, status)
- [ ] `Review` model (client_id, rating, comment)
- [ ] Setup Alembic migrations

## 3. API Features
- [ ] `/tattoos` → CRUD
- [ ] `/bookings` → book/cancel/reschedule
- [ ] `/reviews` → leave/fetch reviews
- [ ] `/clients/{id}` → history

## 4. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests with pytest
- [ ] Integration tests with TestClient
- [ ] Mock DB (SQLite in-memory)

## 5. Best Practices
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] Pydantic settings for config
- [ ] CORS middleware
- [ ] Split routes into `routers/`

## 6. Next-Level (FAANG Style 🚀)
- [ ] Dockerfile + docker-compose
- [ ] PostgreSQL migration
- [ ] Async SQLAlchemy (`asyncpg`)
- [ ] GraphQL layer
- [ ] CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Deploy to AWS/GCP



/tattoos/          GET   → All tattoos (public)
/tattoos/my        GET   → Artist's tattoos
/tattoos/          POST  → Create tattoo (artist)
/tattoos/{id}      GET   → Tattoo by ID (public)
/tattoos/{id}      PUT   → Update tattoo (artist only)
/tattoos/{id}      DELETE→ Delete tattoo (artist only)

/appointments/     POST  → Book appointment (client)
/appointments/my   GET   → Artist sees all bookings
/appointments/client GET → Client sees their own bookings




5️⃣ Extras

Pre-medical history form (optional JSON per client)

Daily quotes / notifications (Celery + Twilio / WhatsApp integration)

Client alerts for healed tattoo uploads

6️⃣ Tech Stack / Engineering Improvements

SQLAlchemy relationships (User → Tattoos → Appointments → Reviews)

Pydantic v2 usage

JWT refresh tokens

Pagination for tattoos/appointments

Validation & custom exceptions

Logging middleware

Async endpoints (for future scalability)

Next Step I Recommend

Create /tattoos/ GET endpoint to fetch all tattoos.

Then implement GET /tattoos/{id} for tattoo detail.

This keeps your flow logical: create → read → update → delete (CRUD).



👉 Next, we’ll add:

Appointments (sessions) → Clients can book tattoos.

Reviews → Clients can leave feedback.

Dashboard → Artists see bookings, clients, reviews.

WhatsApp reminders → Send healed tattoo photo reminders.

Basically → We’re building the engine before we make the UI. 🚀
